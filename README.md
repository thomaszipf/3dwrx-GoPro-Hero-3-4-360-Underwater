This is a Remix from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1304353 originally from martin19791121. I did discover some minor issues as "wrong assembly variants" and screw Driver Diameter not beeing wide enough. I did some work on it to improve it a Little bit more. Now the design should work out of the box once it is printed and assembled.
